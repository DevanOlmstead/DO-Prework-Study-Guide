# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
A website created through an interactive introduction to web development and the 3 cornerstone languages containing notes on various languages I used to create it. It helped emerse me into the language of coding to prepare me for success in the coming bootcamp.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To have a single webpage to access my notes gathered throughout the bootcamp. By using command+option+I (macOS) or control+shift+I (windows) you can pull up the DevTools console enabling you to review the code I learned to create the webpage. See what that looks like in the screenshot below:
